          Pre-Cleaning Process
        </h2>
        <p class="text-blk subHeadingText">
            When paddy comes into the mill from farmers, it contains lots of foreign materials, such as weed seeds, soil, rubbish, and other non-grain materials. 

            Pre-cleaning helps remove these materials to improve the efficiency of huller and milling recovery. No removal of these can result in damage to the machinery by blocking the bin outlets. The grains are passed via a sieve drum and are rotated in a sieve cylinder. The brush attached in the sieve cylinder keeps cleaning it. The product flows over the magnet installed in it which functions as a speed breaker to remove dust and impurities. The grain is separated according to their sizes with the help of separators. The aspiration channel emits the soil with the help of the connection pipe. The pre-cleaner consists of circular, drum pre-cleaner and clobber.

            Modern Cleaning
          </h2>
        <p class="text-blk description">
            Modern cleaning includes a colour sorting process to separate white and contaminated black grains which were earlier used by a durum processor. With the technological advancement and fitting of high-resolution cameras, the grains can be quickly inspected in a broader spectrum to subtle the impurities. Nowadays, UV rays sorting technologies are being used to check foreign materials as they offer better light density. These machines have the potential to provide more output than traditional cleaning methods, thereby improving the overall output quantity. The next step is insecticide treatments and cleaning of premises to destroy the insects before they damage the food.
